# COMPILER IN A WEEK
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ArchimedesPi/compilerinaweek.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ArchimedesPi/compilerinaweek)

I just started reading **"Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools"**,
and thought it would be fun to implement a **very** simple compiler.
That's what this is.

## Building it
Get Flex and Bison, and GCC.
Then, just run `make`.
